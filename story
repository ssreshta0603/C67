Once upon a time,In a forest,there lived a monkey who recided on a berry,
which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest,there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day,the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under a tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits,as he loved them.
